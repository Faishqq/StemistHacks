Hello! Welcome to my project Trigonometry Practice
A brief summary of my project:
Start on the file named "homescreen.py", and the code itself will provide instructions on how to proceed.
There are five other files.
"cosdegrees.py" prompts the user to find the cosine of a given angle in degrees.
"cosradians.py" prompts the user to find the cosine of a given angle in radians.
"sindegrees.py" prompts the user to find the cosine of a given angle in degrees.
"sinradians.py" prompts the user to find the cosine of a given angle in radians.
"unitcircle.py" draw a circle and lines at a certain angle from the center.
At each line, the user has to type what the angle is in degrees and radians.
My program serves mainly to help the user practice getting more familiar with trigonometry.
